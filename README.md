# K9board

## What is it
  K9board is a T9 style Android keyboard, with old-style text prevision.

## Why I am developing this
  I initiated this project due to my dissatisfaction with the QWERTY keyboard on 
WearOS watches. Although I no longer own a smartwatch, the development process
was enjoyable. Additionally, I wanted to create a portfolio project, so I
decided to adapt it for mobile phones. After incorporating old features from
"KeyOboard" and adapting them to Jetpack Compose, I plan to reintroduce the
WearOS version. And at some point I will also bring in new features, so that I
can expand my knowledge base in a fun way.
